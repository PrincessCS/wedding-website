            <h3>ENTRANCE HYMN</h3>
            <p>(All stand as the procession enters the church while the <br>
                choir sings the processional hymn) <br>
               Take Me To The Altar (Jude Nnam) <br>
               (LED BY CHOIR)</p>

             <h3>INTRODUCTORY TIES</h3>
             <p>Priest: In the name of the father, and of the son and of the Holy Spirit. <br>
                  All: Amen <br>
                 Priest: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the <br>
                 fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. <br>
                 All: And with your spirit.</p>


            <h3>THE ACT OF PENANCE</h3>
            <p>Priest: My brothers and sisters, to prepare ourselves to celebrate <br>
                the sacred mysteries, let us call to mind our sins. <br>
                (After a brief silence all says) <br>
                ALL: I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters,  <br>
                that I have greatly sinned in my <br>
                thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and <br>
                in what I have failed to do, through my most grievous faults; therefore <br>
                I ask blessed Mary ever- Virgin, all the Angels and saints, and you, <br>
                my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.
            </p>

            <p>Priest:May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive <br>
                us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. <br>
                ALL: Amen <br>
                Priest: Lord have mercy <br>
                ALL: Lord have mercy <br>
                Priest: Christ have mercy <br>
                ALL: Christ have mercy <br>

                ALL:Glory to God in the highest. And on earth peace of men <br>
                of good will. We praise you. We bless you. We adore. <br>

                Lamb of God, son of the father: you who take away the <br>
                 sins of the world, have mercy on us, you who take away <br>
                 the sins of the world receive our prayers. You, who sit <br>
                 at the right hand of the father, have mercy on us. For <br>
                 you alone are holy, You alone are the Lord. You alone, <br>
                O Jesus Christ, are most high, Together with the Holy Spirit <br>
                in the glory of the father AMEN.

            <h3>OPENING PRAYER</h3>
              <p>PRIEST: Father, you have made the bond of marriage <br>
                a holy mystery, a symbol of Christ love for a church, <br>
                 hear our prayers for AMARA and CHUDI. With faith in <br>
                you and each other they pledge their love today. <br>
                 May their lives always bear to the reality of that Love. <br>
                We ask you this through our Lord Jesus Christ your son, <br>
                who lives, and reigns with you and the <br>
                 Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever <br>
                All: Amen (all sit)</p>

            <h3>LITURGY OF THE WORD</h3>
            <h3>FIRST READING</h3>
              <p>READER: A reading from the book of Ecclesiasticus(Dora's) (26:1-4.13-16) <br>
                Theme: Like the sun rising, so is the beauty of a <br>
                good wife in her well- ordered home. <br>
                Happy is the husband of a good wife; the number <br>
                 of his days will be doubled. A loyal wife <br>
                 rejoices over her husband, and he will complete his <br>
                 years in peace. A good wife is a blessing; she will be <br>
                granted among the blessings of the man who fears the <br>
                 Lord. Whether rich or poor, <br>
                 his heart is glad, and at all times his face is cheerful. <br>
                 A wife's charm delights her husband, and her skill <br>
                 puts fat on his bones. A silent wife <br> 
                 is a gift of the Lord, and there is nothing so <br>
                 precious as a disciplined soul. <br>
                A modest wife adds charm to charm <br>
                , and no balance can weigh the value of a chaste soul. <br>
                 Like the sun rising in the <br>
                 heights of the Lord, so is the beauty of a good <br>
                wife in her well-ordered home. <br>
                The word of the Lord. <br>
                All: Thanks be to God.</p>

                <h3>RESPONSORIAL PSALM Ps. 128</h3>
                  <p>R. O blessed are those who fear the Lord and walk in his ways <br>
                        1. O blessed are those who fear the lord and walk in his ways! <br> 
                        By the labour of you hands you shall eat, you will be happy and prosper (R) <br>
                        2. Your wife will be like a fruitful vine, in the heart of your house, <br>
                        your children like shoots of the olive, Around your table.(R) <br>
                        3. Indeed thus shall be blessed the man who fears the lord. <br>
                        May the lord bless you from Zion All the days of your life (R)</p>

             <h3>SECOND READING</h3>
               <p>Reader: Ephesians 5: 2a, 21-33 (This is the great mystery and <br>
                it applies to Christ and the Church) <br>
               Submit yourselves to one another because of your reverence for <br>
                Christ. Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. For a husband has authority <br>
               over his wife just as Christ has authority over the church; <br>
                and Christ is himself the Saviour of the church, his body. <br>
                And so wives must submit completely to their husbands <br>
                just as the church submits itself to Christ. <br>
                Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church <br>
               and gave his life for it. He did this to dedicate the church to <br>
               God by his word, after making clean by washing it in water, <br>
               in order to present the church to himself in all its beauty - pure and faultless, <br>
                without spot or wrinkle or any other imperfection. <br>
               Men ought to love their wives just as they love their own bodies. <br>
               (No one ever hates his own body. Instead, <br>
               he feeds it and takes care of it, just as Christ does the church; <br>
                for we are members of his body.) As the scripture says, <br>
                "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and <br>
               unite with his wife, and the two will become one." There is a <br>
               deep secret truth revealed in this scripture,  <br>
               which I understand as applying to Christ and the church. <br>
                But it also applies to you: every husband must love his wife as <br>
                himself and every wife must respect her husband. <br>
               The word of the Lord. <br>
               ALL: Thanks be to GOD.</p>

          <h3>GOSPEL ACCLAMATION</h3>
              <h3>ALLELUIA ALLELUIA</h3>
             <p>Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God. <br>
              Whoever loves is a child of God and knows God. Alleluia</p>

            <h3>GOSPEL</h3>
              <p>PRIEST: The lord be with you <br>
                All: And with your spirit <br>
                The priest: <br>
                A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John 15:12-16 <br>
                My Command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. <br>
                You are my friends if you do what I command. <br>
                 I no longer call you servants, because a servant <br>
                 doesn't not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you <br>
                 friends, for everything that I learned from my father I have made known to you. <br>
                 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed <br>
                you to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last . Then the father will give <br>
                 you whatever you ask in my name. This is my command: Love each other. <br>
                The Gospel of the Lord. <br>

                    <h3>THE RITE OF MARRIAGE</h3>
                    <p>Declaration of Consent <br>
                        After the homily, the Bride and the Groom stand;  <br>
                        while the priest addresses them in these words. <br>
                        Priest: AMARA and CHUDI, you have come together in this church so <br>
                         that the Lord may seal and strengthen your love in the <br>
                        presence of the church's minister <br>
                         and this congregation of relatives and friends. Christ abundantly <br>
                        blesses this love. He has already consecrated you in baptism, <br>
                        and now, He assumes the duties <br>
                        of marriage in mutual and lasting fidelity. And so in the presence of the church, <br>
                         I ask you to state your intentions <br>
                         Priest: AMARA and CHUDI, I shall now ask you if you freely undertake the obligations of <br>
                        marriage and to state that there is no legal impediment to your marriage. <br>
                        Have you come freely and without reservations to give yourselves to each other in marriage? <br>
                        Groom: Yes. I have <br>
                        Bride: Yes. I have <br>
                        Priest: Will you honor and respect each <br>
                        other as husband and wife for the rest of your lives? <br>
                        Groom: Yes. I will
                        Bride: Yes. I will</p>

               Priest: Since it is your intention to enter into marriage, <br>

            <p>Father, you have made the union of man and wife so holy a mystery <br>
                that it symbolizes the marriage <br>
                of Christ and his church. Father by your plan man and woman are <br>

                established as the one blessing that was not forfeited by original sin <br>
                or washed away in the flood. Look with love upon this woman, your <br>
                daughter now joined to her husband in marriage. She asks your <br>
                 blessing. Give her your love and peace. <br>

                 Father, keep them always true to your commandment. <br>
                 Keep them faithful in marriage and let them <br>
                  be living examples of Christian life. Give them the <br>

                 , grant them fullness of life with the saints in the kingdom of heaven.  <br>
                 We ask this through Christ our Lord. <br>

                 <p>Priest: Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostle: <br>
                    “I LEAVE YOU PEACE, MY PEACE I GIVE YOU <br>
                   . LOOK NOT OUR SINS BUT ON THE FAITH OF YOUR <br>
                    CHURCH, AND GRANT THE UNITY AND PEACE <br>
                    OF YOUR KINGDOM WHERE YOU LIVE FOR EVER AND EVER”. <br>
                   All: Amen <br>
                   Priest: The peace of the Lord be with you <br>
                   All: And also, with you <br>
                   Priest: Let us offer each other the sign of peace <br>
                   (Here the choir sings) <br>
                   My hands are blessed (2ce) <br>
                   With the blessing of God (2ce) <br>
                   Everything I touch surely must be blessed (2ce) <br>
                   My hands are filled with the blessing of God (2ce)</p>

            <h3> THE KISS OF PEACE</h3>
            <p>After the exchange of peace, the groom <br>
                comes up to the altar where <br>
                he receives the kiss of peace, from the priest and <br>
                 back to his place he gives the kiss to his bride.</p>

                 <h3>LAMB OF GOD</h3>

                     Lamb of God you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace. <br>
                    Priest: This is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world <br>
                    happy are those who are called to his supper <br>
                    All: Lord I am not worthy to receive you, but <br>
                     only say the word and I will be healed</p>

                        Plead with thy Son, for He has paid <br>
                        The price of our iniquity. <br>
                        Virgin most pure, star of the sea, <br>
                        Pray for the sinner, pray for me. <br>
                        
                        And while to Him who reigns above, <br>
                        In Godhead One, in Persons Three, <br>
                        The source of life, of grace and love, <br>
                        Homage we pay on bended knee. <br>
                        Mother and Queen, star of the sea, <br>
                        Pray for thy children, pray for me.</p>

                        <h3>PRAYER AFTER COMMUNION</h3>
                        <p>Priest: Lord in your love, give us this Eucharist to unite with <br>
                            one another and with you. As you have made <br>
                           AMARA and CHUDI one in the sacrament of marriage and  <br>
                           in the sharing of the bread and the cup, <br>
                           so now make them in one love for each other, this we ask  <br>
                           through Christ our Lord.</p>

        <h2>The Blessing</h2>
        <p>The presider prays a solemn blessing over the <br>
            married couple and the whole assembly. All participate <br>
            in the blessing by repeatedly responding, "Amen." <br>
            This blessing may be sung. The ritual text indicates the <br>
            witnesses may sign the marriage license in front <br>
           of the assembly, though never with the license on the altar. <br></p>
                
           <p>Dismissal <br>
           As with any Mass, the presider dismisses the assembly <br>
            with an exchange like "Go in peace to glorify the <br>
            Lord with your life" to which all gathered respond  <br>
           "Thanks be to God." <br>

           <h2>Recessional</h2>
           <p>A recessional, or closing procession, is a natural <br>
            way to conclude the ceremony. <br>
            Though it is not specified in The Order of <br>
             Celebrating Matrimony, the couple, the bridal party, the <br>
             ministers, and the presider process out of the church, <br>
             usually accompanied by <br>
            a festive song or instrumental music. Music suggestions <br>
            for the wedding procession offer suitable <br>
             options. Depending on local custom, the priest may <br>
            invite the couple to exchange a kiss before leaving the sanctuary.</p>
